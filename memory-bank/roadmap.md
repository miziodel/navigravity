# NaviGravity Roadmap & Changelog

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Backlog)

- **Gap Analysis**: Automate the "Dual Identity" check to periodically suggest missing artists.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Mood + BPM + Era combinations.
- **Sonic Flow Refinement**: Improve `get_sonic_flow` to handle "Era" transitions better (e.g., 70s -> 80s bridge).
- **"Album of the Day"**: A notification-based feature to suggest one forgotten masterpiece each morning.

## 🔄 Recurring / Operations
- **Analytical Review**: Bi-weekly analysis of `logs/navidrome_mcp.log` to identify:
  - "Empty Result" queries (bad prompts?).
  - "Low Quality" playlists (bad logic?).
  - Refine system prompts based on findings.
